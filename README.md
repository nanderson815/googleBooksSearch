# Google Books Library

## About This Project
The Google Books library utilizes React and the Google Books API to enable users to search for and save titles they would like to read. The saved books are stored on MongoDB, which serves as a unified reading list for all users.

## Technologies Used
HTML | CSS | JavaScript | MongoDB | Express.js | React | Node.js | Materialize | Heroku

## Note: The database takes ~30 seconds to start and populate saved titles. Please be patient!
